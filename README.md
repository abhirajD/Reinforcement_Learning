# Reinforcement_Learning
Reinforcement learning Practice repository

Following is the list of things I plan to do in this repository:
- Start with basic theory and discuss founding papers of basic Reinforcment learning theory to specialized algorithms.
- Make end to end applications for each algorithm. If possible using the same game.
- Make a web interface to display and compare each algorithm.
- FINISH THIS PROJECT (with persistance and patience).

Side to-do I would like to accomplish:
- Learn *Genetic algorithms* and possibly use it for model selection (as of now I dont know if it can be)


### Q-Learning

Q-Learning algorithms are Reinforment learning algorithms which are a little different than the popular policy-based algorithms.

In this noteboook I wil be discussion the thoery along with a simple q-learning problem.
